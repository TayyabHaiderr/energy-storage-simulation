# Model Assumptions

- Efficiency degradation is modeled as a linear decline over time.
- Depth of discharge is assumed to be 100% for simplicity.
- Cycling behavior is held constant across the system lifetime.
- The model is intended for comparative and educational analysis,
  not site-specific deployment decisions.
